"""
Test suite for the Burger King Street Fighter AI game.

This module contains a comprehensive set of Pytest tests for the BK Street Fighter game,
which is an AI-generated and AI-played fighting game using Pygame. The tests cover various
aspects of the game, including initialization, game mechanics, AI behavior, neural network
integration, and reinforcement learning components.

Key test areas:
1. Game Initialization
2. Fighter and AI Player behavior
3. Game State Management
4. Collision Detection
5. Score Tracking
6. Neural Network Integration
7. Reinforcement Learning
8. Edge Cases and Error Handling

To run these tests, ensure that Pytest is installed and execute:
    pytest test_bk_street_fighter.py

Note: These tests assume the existence of bk_street_fighter.py with specific classes and methods.
Adjust the tests as necessary to match the actual implementation.
